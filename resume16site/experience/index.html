Worked as a volleyball instructor teaching kids ages seven through fifteen how to play the sport. I also lived in a cabin, looking after a group of eleven campers. In these roles I learned how to deal with difficult people with varying personalities. Working with other staff members in this job, I also learned valuable lessons in teamwork and leadership in collaborative efforts.

Worked as part of a team that managed the Boston Landing Development Project. Our team oversaw the design, finances, construction, and leasing of the development. Personally, my workload consisted of filing documents and architectural renderings, attending meetings, researching the local real estate market and potential relationship opportunities and, of course, Go-for-ing.

Worked in the religious school in first, second and third grade classrooms. In addition to working with the youngest members of the synagogue, I regularly attended meetings with fellow faculty members and staff to discuss effective teaching strategies and methods. One important thing I learned was how to capture the attention of a large group of individuals.
