Dogs are cool. Definitely top 10 animal in my book. Other top animals include elephants, giraffes, leopards, and, of course, meerkats. I saw those animals on my recent trip to South Africa. They were all pretty sick. The worst animal we saw was definitely the impala. Impalas were cool for roughly zero seconds. In fact, every time I saw one I just pictured it hanging on the wall of my bedroom back home in Boston, USofA.
